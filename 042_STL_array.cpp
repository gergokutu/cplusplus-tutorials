// STL >> Standard Template Library
// templetized arrays
// halfway between arrays and vectors
// std::array<int, 5> ages = {1, 2, 3};
// ages[0];
// ages.size() >> method of the ages object which wrappes the ages array..
// STL arrays are statically sized
// But they remember their length(size) when being passed to functions
// Arrays passed to functions as pointers
// Vectors passed to functions as values(being copied) >> STL arrays too
// STL array is an array wrapped in an object
// has all the abilities of an array + some extra comes from the object
// we have an extra layer of capabilities like remembering the size

// STL arrays in practice
