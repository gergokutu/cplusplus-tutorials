/*
Intro to Object Oriented Programming
- pretty big topic
- structs
- all C-like programming languages has this concept >
- like Java, C#...
- but there is specifics to C++ OOP

OOP:
- based on classes and objects
- classes the blueprints for its instances (objects)
- we can describes data and real world things as objects
- help to keep things organized
- you can imagine it as an axcel table
  - column names (the structure) > class
  - each individual row (instances) > object

Basic concepts of OOP:
- ?data abstraction
- structs
  - similar to classes
  - used for smaller things than classes
- classes
- members of classes
  - data members (variables inside of a class)
  - methods
  - constructor
  - destructor
- encapsulation
  - hide the inner details of the class
  - give a public interface to interact
- inheritance
  - classes can inherit from other classes
- polimorphism
  - classes can be interpreted as their parent classes...
