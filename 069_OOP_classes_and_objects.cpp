/*
OOP - Classes and objects
- very similar to structs

Class:
- blueprint
- defines the shape of a data structure
- cookie cutter example in the video...
- process of going from a class to an object > instatiation
- User eample in the video... User user1;
- User the type (with class > building your own custom type)
- constructor > spec function (method) wich creates a new user
- inside the class with the same name > User()
- automatically called everytime when a new user instantiated
- do not have to do it like in JS > new User() > !!!NO-NO-NO!!!
- we can define our own methods inside the class
- data members (variable)
- operator overloading (user1 == user2) > any other operator can be overloaded
- static members
  - describe the class in general
  - stay associated with the class
  - e.g number of users intatiated
