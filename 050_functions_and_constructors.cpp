/*
In this video >> 5 types of functions

1. function
  - independent entity
  - normal functions have a return type
  - e.g. int, string...
  - void is a type, too

2. method
  - funcionality-wise is same as function but
  - a method is attached to an object
  - only difference in usage >> how you call them (e.g. obj.func()...)

3. static method
  - e.g string functions like string.length
  - a static method is attached to a class
  - class >> blueprint to how to create objects
  - every single time when we create an instance of a class (e.g. string class)
  - we create a new separate object (e.g. std::string name;)

4. Constructor
  - special function
  - it's called when instantiating a class
  - constructor = ctor
  - does not have a return type
  - because does not return any data but create an object

5. Destructor
  - very similar to ctor
  - called when a object is deleted
  - clean up all the memory
