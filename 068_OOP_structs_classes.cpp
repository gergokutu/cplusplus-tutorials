/*
Intro to structs
- the following concepts can be applied for classes as well
- in other languages the diff between class & struct is much bigger...
- diff between structs and classes is conventional >
- people use struct for smaller and classes for bigger structures
- usually use structs for Plain Old Data Structs (PODS) >
  - inside the struct definition there is only data structs (variables)
  - you can put methods but it's usually avoided by convention
  - very simple variable based things...
- transition is really easy between structs and classes

Access modifiers:
- public
- private
- protected (come up with inheritance)
- members get access modifiers
- you can change default access modifiers

Public:
- when creating an object (an instance)
- public members can be accessed on that object
- structs are members of public by default

Private:
- cannot be accessed on the object (instance)
- but can be accessed on the class/struct
- classes are members of pivate by default
